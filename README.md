# 🚀 AWS Static Web Page Deployment

Excited to announce the successful deployment of a static web page using AWS's advanced networking features, including VPC with servers in private subnets and NAT. This setup ensures enhanced resiliency and security, making it ideal for production environments.

## Highlights

- ✅ VPC setup across two Availability Zones
- ✅ Utilization of Auto Scaling group & Application Load Balancer
- ✅ NAT gateway for internet connectivity
- ✅ Security measures with security groups & route tables

## Deployment Process

The deployment process involved meticulous steps:

1. **Creating VPC:** Configured VPC with CIDR blocks and subnets.
2. **Deploying Application:** Utilized EC2 Auto Scaling group & Load Balancer for deployment.
3. **Testing Functionality:** Thorough testing was conducted to ensure proper functionality.
4. **Cleanup:** Resources were cleaned up and deleted post-deployment to avoid unnecessary costs.
